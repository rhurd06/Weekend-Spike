# Spike Project

## Description

For my weekend Spike project I was exploring upload images through the Cloudinary API. I started out by reading through the material provided on the cloudinary website. To help better understand the material I watched a couple videos found on youtube.

## Setup

You will need postgres running.
`brew services start postgres`
OR
`postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres`

You will need a database called full-stack-react.
Use Postico!

You will need to setup a table per the database.sql.

`npm install`

Other installs I made were:

<ul>
<li>`npm install cloudinary`</li>
<li>`npm install cloudinary-react`</li>
<li>`npm install dotenv`</li>
<li>`npm install react-router-dom`</li>
<li>`npm install pg`</li>
</ul>
Then I began writing my code. I got stuck on the server side and how to connect it with both the database and Cloudinary.
